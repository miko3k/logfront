== Interactive logger

=== Persistent data

Configuration is stored in java.util.prefs.Preferences, so check usual config place for java application in order
to edit or remove such configuration (on linux it is $HOME/.java/.userPrefs, on Windows try registry)

==== Preserving configuration between restarts

Logfront is trying to be smart about persisting settings (such as window location and filter settings) across restarts.

To do this it needs to identifiy current application. Current application name is displayed in window title bar.
It tries a bit but it sometimes fails or yields wrong results. In that case, you can change this behaviour:

Simpliest method which does not introudce any dependency on logfront itself it to add line like this
before your first message is logged:

  System.setProperty("org.deletehis.logfront.application", "MyApplicationName");
